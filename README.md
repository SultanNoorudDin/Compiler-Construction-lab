#Compiler for a Simple Language

This repository contains a compiler implementation for a simple language. The compiler performs lexical analysis, syntactic analysis, semantic analysis, and generates intermediate code and assembly code.

#Features:

##Lexical Analysis: 
Breaks the source code into tokens.
##Syntactic Analysis: 
Parses the token stream to ensure correct syntax.
##Semantic Analysis: 
Checks for type errors and undeclared variables.
##Intermediate Code Generation: 
Generates intermediate code for further optimization and code generation.
##Assembly Code Generation: 
Produces assembly code for a specific target architecture.
#How to Use:

#Example:

int main() {
    int x = 10;
    int y = 20;
    int sum = x + y;
    return sum;
}
Intermediate Code:

t0 = 10
t1 = 20
t2 = t0 + t1
return t2
Assembly Code:

Code snippet

LOAD 10
STORE t0
LOAD 20
STORE t1
LOAD t0
ADD t1
STORE t2
LOAD t2
RET
#Future Improvements:

Error Handling: Enhance error reporting with line numbers and descriptive messages.
Optimization: Implement optimizations like constant folding, dead code elimination, and loop unrolling.
Symbol Table: Extend the symbol table to handle more complex data structures and scopes.
Intermediate Code: Explore different intermediate representations like three-address code or abstract syntax trees.
Code Generation: Target multiple architectures and generate more efficient code.
